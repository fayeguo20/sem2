# Exercise 3: Tasks and solutions

## Task 1:

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Create a self-defined function for calculating BMI from the height and weight.

##Code:

```{r cars}
bmi <- function(weight, height){
  weight / (height / 100) ^ 2  
}
```

## Task 2:

(Continued) Apply this function to the ENV221 students dataset and add a new column for the BMI values.

## Code:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
env <- read.csv("students_env221.csv")
env$BMI <- bmi(env$WEIGHT, env$HEIGHT)
env
```
